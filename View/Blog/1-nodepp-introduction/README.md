# Nodepp: A Powerful Framework for Asynchronous Programming in Arduino and C++

Have you ever wondered why C++, despite being such a powerful language, has been left behind? Let me explain, C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language that has been widely used in a variety of fields, from operating systems to desktop applications and video games. However, despite its power, some people consider it to be left behind compared to other, more modern languages. This is due in part to the complexity and steep learning curve associated with C++, as well as the availability of newer, more user-friendly languages, such as Python and JavaScript.

This has caused many companies to explore new alternatives to replace C++ with languages ​​that offer greater security and ease of use. For example, Microsoft has announced that it is considering using the Rust programming language as an alternative to C/C++ with the aim of improving security in the systems and applications developed by the company. This would free developers from the responsibility of security, which in turn would facilitate the expansion of the functionalities of both the system and the applications more quickly and efficiently.

On the other hands, Google has recently introduced a new programming language called Carbon, which aims to be the successor to C++. The vision behind Carbon is to provide developers with a more modern and productive tool, in order to enable developers to be more productive and take advantage of the modern design of the language.

While it is true that C++ is somewhat complicated, it is interesting that we have never heard the big tech companies propose solutions to improve C++'s shortcomings and features. It seems that the trend is to look for alternatives rather than trying to evolve and improve a language that is so deeply rooted in the industry.

That's why I've decided to create a C++ framework that will unleash the full potential of C++ by making it easier to code. This is intended to enable new programmers to develop complex and scalable code with just a few lines of code, as if it were a high-level language, in order to enable developers to be more productive when writing code in C++.

## What is this framework about?

Nodepp is an innovative framework built in C++ and designed specifically for building concurrent applications with a syntax similar to NodeJS. This combination of features makes Nodepp a powerful tool for building scalable and high-performance applications, leveraging the power of the C++ language and the ease of use offered by NodeJS. By using Nodepp, developers can take advantage of the efficiency and performance of C++ while enjoying the familiarity and convenience of the NodeJS syntax. This allows for more efficient and productive development of concurrent applications, resulting in more scalable and high-performance code. Furthermore, by combining the best of both worlds, Nodepp offers an attractive solution for those looking to leverage the strengths of C++ in the context of building concurrent applications.

### What can we create with Node?

- HTTPS | HTTP | TCP | TLS | UDP | WebSocket servers/clients
- Asynchronous Tasks & Multithreading
- Load Balancing for our web servers
- Readable | Writable Streams
- Events | Promises | Timers
- Coroutines | Generators
- Cryptography ( Openssl )
- Data Compression ( Zlib )

The cool thing is that Nodepp is written in 100% C++ from scratch, without using any standard libraries. The fact that Nodepp is written in pure C++, without relying on any standard libraries, makes it highly portable and compatible with a wide range of devices. This ability to run in various environments is a significant advantage, as it allows developers to use Nodepp on a variety of platforms without worrying about compatibility.

In summary, Nodepp is a powerful framework that simplifies asynchronous programming in C++. The asynchronous nature of Nodepp is central to its utility in application development. Furthermore, Nodepp offers a significant advantage by providing a syntax similar to NodeJS, making the transition easier for those familiar with the NodeJS ecosystem. This makes Nodepp an attractive tool for developers who wish to take advantage of asynchronous programming capabilities in C++ environments.
