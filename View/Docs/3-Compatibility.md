# Compatibility

<hr>

Nodepp is also compatible with Embedded Devices, Emscripten, and so on. This is thanks Nodepp was written in pure C++, without relying on standard libraries, which makes it highly portable and compatible with a wide range of devices. This ability to run in diverse environments is a significant advantage, allowing developers to use Nodepp on a variety of platforms without worrying about compatibility.
