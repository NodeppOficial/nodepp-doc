# The world's first NodeJS-like framework for C++

<hr>

Hello! If you're looking to create real asynchronous applications in C++, you might be interested in Nodepp, an all-in-one C++ framework designed for this purpose.

## What Is Nodepp ?

Nodepp is an innovative open source project that aims to make it easier to create applications in C++. This project introduces a high-level abstraction layer that allows developers to write C++ code in a way that is similar to how they would write code in NodeJS. With Nodepp, developers can leverage the advantages of the C++ language while benefiting from the ease of use and flexibility that NodeJS offers. This unique combination of features makes Nodepp a powerful tool for creating high-performance and scalable applications. Additionally, since it is an open source project, anyone can contribute and improve Nodepp to fit their specific needs.
